NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::DebugDump - dump objects to debug log with Data::Dumper

DESCRIPTION
    Provides a `debug_dump' keyword, which takes an optional label and an
    object or reference to dump, and calls Dancer's `debug' keyword after
    dumping the object / reference with Data::Dump.

    Allows quick and easy debugging by dumping stuff to your log/console.

SYNOPSIS
        use Dancer::Plugin::DebugDump;

        debug_dump("My nice object" => $object);
        debug_dump("My hash" => \%hash);
        debug_dump($anotherref);
