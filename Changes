Revision history for Dancer-Plugin-DebugDump

        Deprecating.
        Dancer's built-in debug() keyword automatically serialises these days,
        so there's no reason for this plugin to exist.  I'll leave it on CPAN
        for the time being for anyone who is already using it, but will withdraw
        it at some point in the future.
